Dear Yuhang,

Got the correct instructions for the server.

To generate the zip file, you have to send an HTTP request to:

http://visage.cs.ucl.ac.uk/VisAge/GetContent

This will return a blank page, but causes the server to create the file.

If you query:

http://visage.cs.ucl.ac.uk/VisAge/GetLastZipTime

You receive text back which is just the timestamp of the last zip file 
creation (in UNIX time).

You can then run the request:

http://visage.cs.ucl.ac.uk/VisAge/FileServer/VisAge.zip

This should download the actual zip file.

The step we missed before was calling GetContent.

Cheers,

Simon
